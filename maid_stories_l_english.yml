 maid_story.102.d:0 "In the summer, mosquitoes flying all over the sky are attracted by the stench of rotten bodies on the ground.\nMosquito bites, rotten corpses and dirty muddy water gradually numb the hearts of children who grew up in the clean and beautiful countryside.\nWhen it snows in winter, everything is buried. The solidified blood so beautifully forming into ice crystals.\nWhile digging trenches, sometimes hard things are dug. They are frozen and stiff bodies of enemies and companions.\n\"I also saw many maid skirts... Many maid skirts dyed red... They were lying quietly in the snow.\"\n\"They can't wait for the day they wake up.\""

No matter how beautiful their faces were, they were torn off to reveal their gums and bones... Mud, blood and flesh were mixed together, just like the gravy in a meat can. I can't even distinguish what food is.\"\nWith her head in her arms, she knelt painfully against the wall.\nHer thoughts are still on the bloody front line.\n\"When you lie on the grass, you can see the red blood flowing inside the leaves of the grass when the sunlight shines through it...\"\nFinally, she smiled."
